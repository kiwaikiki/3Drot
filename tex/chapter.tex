\chapter{A Sample Text}

Use chpater in the Slovak language version as a guide
to write chapters in English. Here we only cite some references, such
as a book about LaTeX \cite{Oetiker2000}, a scientific journal article
\cite{clanok}, a conference paper \cite{clanok_na_konferencii}, a
technical report \cite{technical_report}, a book \cite{kniha}, and a
resourse from the Internet \cite{smernica}.
